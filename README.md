# Research Goals:
1) Document if G. mordax can use chemical stimuli alone to detect prey and to navigate to a specific prey location
2) Assess if behavioral responses vary between chemical cues from different prey species
3) Test if these cues can be used in both fully submerged and partial exposed (intertidal) contexts. 

To accomplish this, we conducted two summers of field-based behavioral experiments on Santa Catalina Island, California, testing chemical stimuli from four prey types during both high and low tidal conditions, the former necessitating partially emerged locomotion over rocky substrate. 

# Data Details
** Below lists the column names and describes that content of each column for MultiSummer.csv ** 

Summer:  Sampling year -  2022 or 2023

Site: Sample Sites 1-8 (experimental location, repeatedly tested for each treatment, tidal condition, and year)

Depth: Submerged or Exposed (submerged = > 1m, Exposed < 5cm)

Treatment:  Anchovy, Kelpbass, Squid, Octopus, Control (types of chemical cue)

Trial Length: Time in Seconds - should be ~900, but some trials ran shorter due to disturbances. 

Trial_Length_Frame_Adjusted: Trial length, but starting when the eel enters the frame for the first time -- so 1st frame enter = start of the trial [NOT USED IN THESE ANALYSES]

VisitedTrial: Yes/No (Did an eel visit this trial??)

Arrival_Frame: Time stamp in seconds for the first eel arriving into the frame

VisitedTube: Yes/No (Did an eel visit the target tube during this trial)?

Arrival_Tube: Time stamp in seconds for Arrival of first eel to enter target tube

Tube_Location_Time: Time in seconds (How long it took the eel to find the target tube after entering the frame)

DurationTube: Time in seconds (time span at least 1 eel was present in the target tube)

MaxTube: Integer (maximum eels in target tube at a time)

TubeEnter: Integer Tally (number of times any eel during a trial entered the target tube) 

FrameEnter23: Integer Tally (for the 2023 trials only; the number of times any eel entered the frame) - Data not used here 

Notes: Any notes related to the trial
